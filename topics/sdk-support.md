## Initial Contact

Before you start an integration project, we prefer to schedule a kick-off meeting to provide consulting.
[Getting Started with Custom Integrations](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/categories/10209837818770-Build-With-Acrolinx)
summarizes integration options and the process of developing an integration.
This information will help you ask the right questions during the kick-off.
Have you already thought about a [Proof of Concept](poc.md)?

## Certification Meeting

* Have you completely finished the integration? Or do you still have open technical questions?
* Have you verified that everything is done?
  Complete the [minimal certification requirements](minimal-requirements.md).
* Share a link to a Scorecard. We'll use the
  [request validator](https://support.acrolinx.com/hc/en-us/articles/10220886837522-How-To-Use-the-Request-Validator)
  to analyze the request and identify any issues.
* Are you prepared to give a demo during the meeting?
