# How to Develop Acrolinx Integrations

## About This Document

This document provides the standards for developing integrations at Acrolinx.

It includes answers to questions that developers had during previous projects.
But it's not comprehensive. If you'd like to add something, please contribute.

Even if you're eager to [start your new project](https://docs.acrolinx.com/customintegrations),
first take the time to read this document carefully. The Coding Guidance might save you a lot of trouble and time later.

This document is no replacement for:

- a good education,
- a stack of [good coding books](topics/coding-style.md), or
- the experience and intuition of a *good* developer.

You don't have to agree with all the recommendations.
And you might find exceptions where it makes sense to implement something differently.
Sometimes there are good reasons *not* to do good things.

Make sure that:

- your reasons are good enough,
- you can explain them, and
- it's not just your personal attitude ;-).

The audience of this document is primarily developers of Acrolinx Sidebar integrations.
Some sections also address development of the Acrolinx Platform and embedded integrations.

## Before You Start

Contact [Acrolinx SDK support](topics/sdk-support.md) for consulting and requesting certification of your integration.

Make sure you properly configure your IDE (integrated developer environment).

You can find the default Acrolinx settings and templates in this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/acrolinx/acrolinx-coding-guidance.git

Review the [IDE Settings](ide-settings).
